This is a final project I completed with a partner in a class we did various projects in SQL, R and JMP. I haven't used JMP before this class, and because I already
understand how to do basic ETL, EDA, and building predictive models this tool made it that much quicker. 
My partner and I wanted to do the project in both JMP and R for extra credit and to be able to compare.
